\section{Problem 2: GEOMETRICAL MODIFICATION}\label{problem-2-geo-modify}
In this problem, please design several geometrical modification algorithms to meet the following requirements. Your results donâ€™t have to be exactly the same as sample images, just try to make the effects.

\subsection{(a)}\label{2_a}
Please design an algorithm to make \textbf{sample3.jpg} become \textbf{sample4.jpg}. Output the result as \textbf{result6.jpg}. Please describe your method and implementation details clearly. (hint: you may perform rotation, scaling, translation, etc.)

    \label{sample3}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Motivation}
I think we could observe \nameref{prob2a_reference_line} and get:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rotate $78^{\circ}$.
    \item Scale up $150$\%.
    \item Shift from current to $(-200, 150)$.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Reference line of problem 2 (a)}
    \label{prob2a_reference_line}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Approach}
We could follow the structure of \textbf{generalized linear geometrical transformation}, and use \textbf{backward treatment} in \textit{Lec 3 page 56 \& 50}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design the \textbf{translation, scaling, rotation} matrix as operators in \textit{Lec 3 page 54}.
    \item Build operators $A^{-1}$, which is inverse of multiplication of above operations $A$.
    \item Build \textbf{grid map} of \textit{xy vectors}. \\
    Remember shift it to center by minus $(\frac{\mbox{width}}{2}, \frac{\mbox{height}}{2})$ of image size. \\
    As original point is the center of image.
    \item Get \textit{uv vectors} by applying inverse transform $A^{-1}$ on \textit{xy vectors}.
    \item Shift \textit{uv vectors} \& \textit{xy vectors} to original position by add $(\frac{\mbox{width}}{2}, \frac{\mbox{height}}{2})$.
    \item Get pixels within image boundaries. That means check whether \textit{uv vectors} are all in the image range.
    \item Create the blank canvas and draw from the original image on it. \\
    I use the \textbf{nearest neighbor interpolation} by rounding \textit{xy vectors} as well as \textit{uv vectors} into integer.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Performance of results}
As former observation, I select rotate $78^{\circ}$, scale up $150$\% and
shift to $(-200, 150)$.

Result of problem 2(a): \nameref{result6}.

    \label{result6}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Discussion}
I also try the \textbf{forward treatment}, and we could see some \alert{black grid} over the image \nameref{result6}.

    \label{result6_forward}
\end{figure}

\subsection{(b)}\label{2_b}
Imagine that there is a black hole in the center absorbing \textbf{sample5.jpg}. Please design a method to make \textbf{sample5.jpg} look like \textbf{sample6.jpg} as much as possible and save the output as \textbf{result7.jpg}.

Original image \nameref{sample5} for question \nameref{2_b}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{hw2_sample_images/sample5.jpg}
    \caption{\textbf{sample5.jpg}}
    \label{sample5}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Motivation}
After observing \nameref{prob2b_reference_line}, I feel maybe we could start from \textit{Polar coordinate system}. Because it seems the \textbf{twisted} of original image grid map.

    \caption{Reference line of problem 2 (b)}
    \label{prob2b_reference_line}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Approach}
Thanks to TAs and my friends explanation. I try this steps of \textit{blackhole}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set up the parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{rotation\_radius}: radius of rotation from center.
        \item \texttt{twist\_scale}: The scale of twist.
        \item \texttt{hole\_radius}: the radius of holw. \\
        Note: it is a litter different from \texttt{rotation\_radius}, it affects \textbf{size of absorbing center}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Calculate radius $r$ \& angle $\theta$ from center of image.
    \item Calculate \alert{absorbing scale} w.r.t radius and \texttt{rotation\_radius} with formula \\
    \(\mbox{absorb\_scale} = 0.4(1.0 - \frac{r}{\mbox{rotation\_radius}})^8\)
    \item We only change the \textbf{absorb scale} $>0$ as we could absorb the pixels to radius $=0$.
    \item Create the blank canvas and draw from the original image on it. \\
    I use the \textbf{nearest neighbor interpolation} by rounding \textit{xy vectors} as well as \textit{uv vectors} into integer. \\
    Note: A little difference here is we need to give \textbf{different scale} for \texttt{absorb\_scale}. So I go back to use \texttt{for loop} instead of matrix.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Performance of results}
In the end, I select the following parameters as the last submission.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{rotation\_radius = 1000.0}
    \item \texttt{twist\_scale = 0.4}
    \item \texttt{hole\_radius = 100}
\end{itemize}

Result of problem 2(a): \nameref{result7}.

    \caption{\textbf{result7.jpg} of problem 2 (b)}
    \label{result7}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Discussion}

The original idea is making a \textbf{vortex}. But we couldn't get the operators $A$ \& $A^{-1}$ at this time.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build \textbf{grid map} of \textit{xy vectors}. \\
    Remember shift it to center by minus $(\frac{\mbox{width}}{2}, \frac{\mbox{height}}{2})$ of image size. \\
    As original point is the center of image.
    \item Convert from \textit{Cartesian Coordinates} $(x, y)$ to \textit{Polar Coordinates} $(r, \theta)$ (radius and angle).
    \item Design \textbf{spiral transformation}, this is my \alert{main parts}: \\
    Let we inverse $(r, \theta)$ backward to $(\rho, \phi)$, given scalar $k$, s.t.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\phi = \theta + \frac{k}{r + \epsilon}$
        \item $\rho = r$
    \end{itemize}
    Where $\epsilon$ is a small number to prevent \texttt{divide by zero}.
    \item Get \textit{uv vectors} by converting from \textit{Polar Coordinates} $(\rho, \phi)$ to \textit{Cartesian Coordinates} $(u, v)$.
    \item Shift \textit{uv vectors} \& \textit{xy vectors} to original position by add $(\frac{\mbox{width}}{2}, \frac{\mbox{height}}{2})$.
    \item Get pixels within image boundaries. That means check whether \textit{uv vectors} are all in the image range.
    \item Create the blank canvas and draw from the original image on it. \\
    I use the \textbf{nearest neighbor interpolation} by rounding \textit{xy vectors} as well as \textit{uv vectors} into integer.
\end{enumerate}

It is really difficult to me that I can't figure out how to make \alert{absorbing effects}. My approach is creating the \alert{spiral}. But it keeps the center as \textit{vortex} not \textit{black hole}.

Maybe it is not a good way to conduct geometrical transformation on \textit{Polar coordinates}.
